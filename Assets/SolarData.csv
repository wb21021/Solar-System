The name of the Sun comes from Proto-Germanic sunnōn. As in most ancient cultures; the Sun was believed to be a god; for which sunnōn was its name. While to Earth; it may appear that we orbit the stationary Sun; it in fact orbits the centre of the Milky Way. The centre of the sun; which generates all of its energy via nuclear fusion; is about 15 million °C. Where we define the surface of the Sun (the photosphere); the temperature is much cooler; at around 5500 °C. However; for reasons unknown to scientists to this day; the corona (which surrounds the Sun’s surface) is actually much hotter than the photosphere; at around 2 million °C. One key feature on the ‘surface’ of the Sun are sunspots; which appear as black spots when the Sun is viewed using specialist equipment (aside: NEVER look at the Sun directly). In reality; these black spots are simply cooler regions than the surrounding photosphere; but observing how these spots change over time can help us better understand the dynamics of the surface. While the Sun is popularly depicted as yellow/orange in culture; it is in fact truly white; and our atmosphere; especially at sunrise and sunset; scatters the blue and violet colours into our atmosphere (hence why the sky is blue); leaving behind the yellow light of the Sun. ,#FFD05A

It has the shortest orbit of any planet; consisting of 88 days. The temperature on the surface of Mercury varies greatly; with regions around the equator reaching 420 °C during the Mercurian day; and plummeting to -170 °C at night. The surface is heavily cratered due to its high velocity and close distance to the Sun; essentially acting as a sponge for elongated asteroid impacts. Mercury also contains what are known as ‘mare-like plains’ which are ancient basaltic flats that indicate that the planet has been geologically inactive for many billions of years. Due to Mercury’s close proximity to the Sun; and its high velocity compared to that of Earths; it takes an incredible amount of fuel to safely land on its surface; hence why only three space probes have successfully made it to the surface.,#D8D3CF

The terrestrial planet has such a dense atmosphere; that any energy captured from the nearby sun is trapped in its atmosphere (an extreme greenhouse effect); meaning that despite being further away from the Sun; it is actually on average hotter than Mercury (~ 460 °C ). At surface level; due to these high pressures and temperatures; it can be considered a supercritical fluid at that point; meaning that the distinct phases between liquid and gas do not exist. Due to Venus’ close proximity to earth and its highly reflective atmosphere; it is the third brightest object in the sky; after the Sun and the Moon. The planet is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty (the only planet named after a female god); and keeping with that theme; most of its features are named after women.,#EC9C2A

The ‘Red Planet’ gets its nickname from the orange-red iron oxide dust covering its surface. The surface of Mars; despite its red appearance; is deathly cold; with temperatures reaching as low as -78.5 °C. Mars is also home to some of the most extreme geological features in the Solar System; such as Valles Marineris (one of the largest canyon systems in the Solar System); and the extinct volcano Olympus Mons (the largest mountain in the Solar System). The seasons on Mars are very Earth-like; due to the two planets having similar rotational axes. One of the main interests of Mars to researchers however; is potential evidence of the previous presence of liquid water; and therefore potentially life. The strongest evidence supporting this is the structure of current landforms that follow similar structures to Earth’s rivers and ocean surface. It is; however; not possible to find liquid water presently on Mars; due to its low atmospheric pressure. Mars does have two large polar ice caps; but these sublimate (go directly from ice to steam). If they were to somehow melt; it would cover Mars with oceans. There is still no direct evidence of the previous existence of Martian life; but more and more research is done every-day via rovers; such as NASA’s Perseverance.,#CF9466
Ceres ,Dwarf Planet,9.38E+20,0.00016,469.7,0.07372,2.98,2.55,73.6,2.77,10.6,1680,0.37808,4,3.34,2.1616,170,0.029,0,0,0,0.0785,80.3,99.5134,1.99E+30,Sun,Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt; and is the closest dwarf planet to Earth. It consists of 25% of the asteroid belt's total mass; and was declared to be a dwarf planet in 2006. Ceres comes from the name of the Roman goddess of harvest. It is classified as a dwarf planet as it fits all of the physical characteristics of a planet; but has not cleared its orbit (the asteroid belt). Ceres cannot be seen within the night sky without a telescope; accounting for its size and low reflectivity. Even then; most telescopes struggle to perfectly visualise its surface. The space probe Dawn is the closest humans have gotten to the dwarf planet in 2015; in which it was able to take detailed photographs and determine that its surface is a mixture of ice and clay. It is a world of frozen mud.,#757575
Jupiter,Planet,1.90E+27,317.8,69911,10.973,5.457,4.9506,273.867,5.2038,1.303,4332.59,0.41354,3.13,-9.4,1.326,165,2.528,95,0,0,0.0489,100.464,33.8078,1.99E+30,Sun,Jupiter is the oldest and largest planet in the Solar System; both in mass and size; so is aptly named after the king of the Roman gods. If you added up the masses of all other planets in the Solar System; Jupiter’s mass would still be double that sum. Jupiter’s truly gigantic mass explains its complex and fascinating atmosphere; as if it has the highest mass; then it too has the highest gravitational force; meaning it can retain lighter gases in its atmosphere; such as hydrogen and helium. Closer to the surface of Jupiter; the pressure and temperature increases; compressing the helium into the largest ocean in the Solar System; composed not of water; but liquid helium. Due to its thick and tumultuous atmosphere; scientists are still unsure about what truly lies at Jupiter’s core; but it is likely a dense solid mass. Jupiter has the shortest rotational period of any planet in the Solar System (about 10 hours). This fast angular momentum drives the strong jet streams of sulphur and phosphorus; creating powerful and long lasting storms. The most famous storm is the Great Red Spot; which is twice the size of Earth; and has been taking place for at least 300 years. The first moons discovered besides our local moon were Jupiter’s four largest moons discovered by Galileo Galilei: Io; Europa; Ganymede; and Callisto. These are known as the Galilean moons; but due to the huge gravitational field created by Jupiter; it in fact has 95 confirmed moons. Like all gas giants; Jupiter has very faint rings composed of small dark dust particles.,#D5B89C
Saturn,Planet,5.68E+26,95.159,58232,9.1402,10.1238,9.0412,339.392,9.5826,2.485,10755.7,0.4375,26.73,-9.7,0.687,134,1.065,146,120700,20,0.0565,113.665,249.2766,1.99E+30,Sun,Saturn’s name comes from the Roman god of wealth; and Jupiter’s father; and is the farthest planet that was discovered by the naked eye. Like Jupiter; it is a gas giant; and like all gas giants; it has rings. But unlike the other gas giants; Saturn’s are by far the most visible and prominent. The famous rings of Saturn are mainly made up of ice and rock; ranging from the size of a speck of dust to about 20 m in thickness; orbiting the gas giant. Some of Saturn’s moons; such as Pandora and Prometheus; act as ‘shepherds’ of the rings; and keep them confined using their gravitational fields. The reason for the formation of Saturn’s rings is still unknown; but a study in 2023 revealed a suggestion that the rings of the gas giant may have been formed from the collision of two Saturnian moons. The atmosphere of Saturn is similar to Jupiter (composed mostly of hydrogen and helium). One prevalent feature is the persistent hexagonal storm at Saturn’s north pole. Most researchers theorise that the shape is formed via a standing-wave pattern; and the storm garners much insight into Saturn’s atmosphere. Saturn currently has 146 confirmed moons orbiting it; the most of any planet in the Solar System. Interestingly; Saturn is also the least dense planet in the Solar System; and the only one which has a density less than water.,#D5B98C
Uranus,Planet,8.68E+25,14.536,25362,3.981,20.0965,18.2861,96.999,19.19126,0.773,30688.5,-0.71833,82.23,-7.2,1.27,76,0.886,27,NaN,1000,0.04717,74.006,246.8864,1.99E+30,Sun,Uranus is the first of the two Ice Giants; and is named after the Greek god of the sky. The classification ‘Ice Giant’ is; due to the lower temperature; a world which contains a higher concentration of more volatile molecules than Jupiter and Saturn; such as methane. As a gas giant; the majority of Neptune’s icy atmosphere is hydrogen and helium. However; the majority of its mass is water; methane (where it gets its blue-green colour); and ammonia. These form a hot; dense fluid; near the core. The complex atmosphere is the coldest in the Solar System; reaching minimum temperatures of -224 °C.  Just as with the other gas giants; Uranus has a very faint ring system; as well as 27 moons. The moons of Uranus are all named after characters from William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope; as opposed to the typical nomenclature of Ancient Deities. Uranus is the only planet besides Venus to exhibit retrograde rotation: it spins in the opposite direction to the other planets. The icy giant has a very strange magnetosphere; whereas most magnetic fields are aligned with their respective planet’s rotation; Uranus’ is tilted 60 degrees from the axis of rotation. Due to this; the auroras that occur on the planet do not happen on the poles as on Earth. The only spacecraft to have ever come close to Uranus is the Voyager 2 probe; when it flew by in 1986. Using the powerful telescopes of today; much can be studied and discerned; however; the CNSA (The Chinese National Space Administration) plans to visit in the near future.,#CCF2F5

It is more than 30 times further from the Sun as Earth is; and orbits the Sun once every 165 years. Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea. If a spaceship was travelling at the speed of light; it would still take a little under four hours to reach Neptune from Earth. Neptune has 14 moons that have been discovered. It is the densest gas giant in the Solar System; and due to this and its slightly smaller size than Uranus; Neptune has a large gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Just as with all gas giants; it has no clearly defined surface. The existence of Neptune was actually predicted before it was discovered; by the French astronomer Alexis Bouvard; due to Neptune’s visible effect on Uranus’ observed orbit. Just as with Uranus; the only man-made object to come close to the solitary ice-world was Voyager 2 in 1989. Similarly to Jupiter’s Great Red Spot; Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot on Neptune’s surface: a giant storm that has since dissipated. Neptune’s atmosphere contains mostly hydrogen and helium; but the bright and vivid blue colour it exhibits is caused by an unknown molecule/component unknown to scientists.,#4368FD
Pluto,Dwarf Planet,1.30E+22,0.00218,1188.3,0.1868,49.305,29.658,113.834,39.482,17.16,90560,-6.387,123.53,-0.44,1.854,44,0.063,5,0,0,0.2488,110.299,77.6538,1.99E+30,Sun,Pluto has an interesting history in human culture. It is most famous for its demotion from Planet to Dwarf Planet status; due to revaluation in 2006 of what defines a Planet; more specifically; that for a planet to be a planet; it must have cleared its orbit. Pluto; being a member of the Kuiper belt; did not fit this description. While Pluto still holds to the typical naming convention of Roman deities for planets; it was named by 11 year old Venetia Burney; whose grandfather forwarded the suggestion to the Lowell Observatory. There is speculation that she was naming the planet after the cartoon dog Pluto; while in fact it was the other way around; as Pluto debuted the same year as the Dwarf Planet was named; 1930. The orbit of Pluto is unique; as it is more elliptical than most of the planets and is also heavily tilted (57 degrees) with respect to the Sun. Due to the shape of its orbit; Pluto was actually closer to the Earth than Neptune was in 1979-1999; during its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion). Pluto has five moons; with its most major being Charon; which is almost half of the size of Pluto. Due to their relative size (the largest in the Solar System) and close proximity; Pluto and Charon are often considered as a binary planet system. Compared to Earth; Pluto is about a sixth of its size.,#DEE4E0

Due to its distance from Earth (about 45 times further than the distance between the Earth and the Sun); and its size (a third of the size of Pluto); Haumea has not been directly observed; but from calculations; astronomers have concluded it has the shape of a Jacobi ellipsoid (the same shape as a rugby ball); one of the only major orbiting bodies to have that shape. The dwarf planet is; however; very reflective due to a thin layer of ice on its surface. Haumea was declared a dwarf planet in 2005; but had actually been first photographed in 1955; originally thought to be a star due its high reflectivity.,#F4F1EF
Makemake,Dwarf Planet,3.10E+21,5.19E-04,715,0.1122,52.756,38.104,294.834,45.43,28.98,111845,0.9511,0,-0.12,1.7,32,0.0581,1,0,0,0.16126,79.62,171.2685,1.99E+30,Sun,Named after the Rapa Nui god of fertility; not much is known about the distant dwarf planet Makemake. It is currently the second brightest object in the Kuiper belt after Pluto; and appears to have a red-brown colour. It is theorised to contain grains of frozen methane on its surface; as well as many other complex hydrocarbons; such as ethylene and acetylene. Makemake; despite its relative brightness; was discovered quite late compared to other dwarf planets (2005); due to its high inclination; it doesn’t orbit the Sun on a similar plane to most of the other planets.,#A8877E

After its discovery; and months of debate on how to classify the body; Eris was determined to be a dwarf planet; bringing Pluto with it. Fittingly; the name Eris comes from the Greek goddess of discord. Eris is so cold and distant from the Sun; that its own atmosphere collapses in on itself; freezing and forming ‘snow’ on its surface. Very little is known about Eris’ composition and structure.,#CBCED7
